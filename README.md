Merry Christmas, buddy! ðŸ˜‰

The enclosed represents an artistic attempt, with a data-driven flair, to visually represent your female fatale (favorite musicians).

(Open, then read the below later)

Using the Spotify API, I looped through each of your public playlists and made a list of all the songs within those playlists. I then counted which artists appeared the most frequently, and then which of their songs appeared most frequently, across your public playlists. Since song listening counts arenâ€™t available via API, this was the next best proxy for your favorite artists and songs. The pictures were created by mixing images from Google with a world cloud package in the programming language Python.

Hereâ€™s your top five:
Mariah Carey - A No No
Taylor Swift - Cornelia Street
Lana Del Rety - Doin' Time
Ariana Grande - imagine
Charli XCX - Blame It on Your Love (feat. Lizzo)
